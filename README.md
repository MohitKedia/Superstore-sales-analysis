In this project. I have performed excel keyboard shortcuts along with Data Cleaning in Excel. I have also attached a file where I am showing how to calculate different functions in Excel. Lastly, I have made pivot charts and interactive dashboard from Super store sales dataset. In the dashboard, I have created list of 15 questions and then I have answered those questions visually. Filters or slicers in the data are Year, Segment, Region, Category and Ship Status.
